While growing up, Morgan aspired to play baseball in college but after an elbow injury, he chose to pursue music. In 2014, Morgan Wallen competed in Season 6 of The Voice, but was eliminated during playoffs. He then went on to release his first EP in 2015.

It was in August of 2020 that If I Know Me reached #1 on the Top Country Albums chart. After that, Morgan released Dangerous: The Double Album which also remained atop the Billboard 200 chart. This album became the only country album in the 64-year history of the Billboard 200 to spend its first 7 weeks in the number 1 spot. My top 3 favorite Morgan Wallen songs include:
